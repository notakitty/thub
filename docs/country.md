## Poland
[Poland Breaches EU Obligations Over LGBT, Women’s Rights](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/02/24/poland-breaches-eu-obligations-over-lgbt-womens-rights)

## Italy
There are [limited legal protections](https://rainbowmap.ilga-europe.org/countries/italy/) for LGBT individuals. Legislation may vary by region, but Tuscany has generally been safer and more accepting for LGBT people.

## UK
note: scotland and wales are slightly better but are ultimately under the rule of the central government.
The UK has very long wait times (often over 5 years) and private access is very expensive. Transphobia is significant both in institutions and the press.

#### ⚠ The [Cass review](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/children-and-young-peoples-gender-services-implementing-the-cass-review-recommendations/) has been implemented in 2024 and access to youth trans healthcare has been halted. 
#### ⚠ The [Levy review](https://www.england.nhs.uk/commissioning/spec-services/npc-crg/gender-dysphoria-clinical-programme/review-of-adult-gender-dysphoria-services/) is currently under way. This may affect the accessibility of adult trans healthcare services.

The Cass review has been rejected by most international and national medical institutions, however the UK government and NHS ignored the warnings and decided to implement it anyway.
