#### ‚ùì **Why This Page?**

The availability of gender-affirming healthcare in the UK has become increasingly restricted. The **Cass Review**, a comprehensive investigation into gender identity services, has resulted in significant changes to how transgender healthcare is delivered, particularly for children and young people.

In June 2024, the UK government, acting on the recommendations of the Cass Review, introduced **new restrictions on puberty blockers**, effectively banning their prescription outside of clinical trials. This has severely limited access to what was previously a vital medical option for young people experiencing gender dysphoria. The review also raised concerns over the use of gender-affirming treatments without offering substantial scientific evidence to back its claims, further complicating access to timely and necessary care.

There are now alarming indications that the government intends to extend these restrictions to **adult services**, further threatening access to gender-affirming healthcare for the entire transgender population in the UK. This move would represent a significant rollback of healthcare rights and could place the UK among the most restrictive environments for trans healthcare in Europe.
