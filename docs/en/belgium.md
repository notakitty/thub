So you are considering moving to Belgium? The great news is that Belgium is generally very LGBT+ friendly! There are plenty of rainbow meet-up groups, caf√©'s, and Pride events going on throughout the year.

The country is very multicultural as well, so you will hear a lot of different languages as you walk through the streets on your way to getting a croissant from the "bakkerij" or "boulangerie". Belgium has three national languages as well just to make things more complicated üòâ

However, Belgium's diversity adds a lot of complexity. There are problems with some regions being far-right, multiple governments, and very localised services. For such a small country, it can sometimes be overwhelming! So, if you don't want to deal with a lot of bureaucracy, Belgium might not be the country for you.

>"There are 5 regional governments and 1 federal government. Each federated state has its own government. As an exception, the federated states of the Flemish Community and the Flemish region have a single Flemish government. As such, there are 5 regional governments in Belgium and 1 federal government."

Because of the complex nature of Belgium we have tried to include links to as many regional differences as possible. We always welcome contributors to add extra information, so if you would like to participate sign up to our Discord. The link can be found in the Menu.

When you arrive in Belgium there are processes for all newcomers to follow. How that looks depends on which region you move to due to the different governments.

üè° **Living Here** üè°

* Quality of Life Index score: 166.73 numero score on 04/09/2024
* The [Cost of living](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Belgium) according to numbeo.
* The housing Price Index in Quarter 3 of the financial year 2023 was 137.92 [Source](https://statbel.fgov.be/en/figures)

Belgium is one of the countries with the highest taxes in the world. You will pay your income taxes once a year following your tax assessment so you will need to make sure you put wages aside each month in preparation to pay your tax. There is also a ground tax for your house and various other taxes that always seem to appear from nowhere. 

‚úèÔ∏è TIP: A quick way to fit in with Belgian people is to complain about how much taxes you have to pay!

Housing prices vary around the country, but on average it is more expensive in the "Vlaanderen" region. For an idea of prices, you can visit Statista's [Average price of a house in Belgium from 2013 to 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/666792/average-housing-prices-in-belgium/).

‚úèÔ∏è TIP: The best website to find somewhere to live is [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/en). You can use it in English and it works very similarly to Rightmove in the UK.

Food can be expensive in Belgium as a lot of it is imported goods. If you are on a budget, supermarkets like Aldi, Lidl or Colruyt are excellent options.

Caf√©s always offer good quality but cheaper meals if you want to go out for a meal without spending a fortune. Just be aware that customer service is very different to in the UK and is much slower paced. Going for a meal or drinks will take you much longer than it would in the UK so be sure to factor that into your planning.

There are many takeaway options in Belgium. They have the usuals like McDonalds and Dominoes, but they also have their chain called Quick. You can grab a kebab from a "kebap" shop but you won't find any Fish n Chip shops. Belgians go to a shop called a "frituur" in the Vlaanderen region (they also have these in the Netherlands!) which sells the world's best chips (or frietjes/frites!) alongside lots of unique fried goods. We recommend you dip your chips in "joppie saus" or truffle mayo, then accompany it with "Bitterballen" or the "biccy burger".

üìö **Studying Here**üìö
Belgium has some of the best universities in the world. International students flock to Leuven as their medical school has an excellent reputation. Cities like Leuven are very used to speaking English as a lingua franca so many shops and activities will be English-speaking.

Most of the university cities have a similar situation, as well as many degrees are now being taught exclusively in English. Whilst studying you can learn one of the three national languages, and they take great care of their students. 

Once you have graduated you can also stay in the country for an additional period whilst you decide to either take further studies or obtain work.

### Local climate

The climate is usually described as mild in Belgium. It is similar to the UK but on average has much less rainfall. You will see much more dramatic thunder and lightning storms here so look out for those! It's like watching storms in films.

### Languages

Since 1st January 2024, to apply for Belgian residency, you need to speak at least one of the three official languages (French, Dutch, or German) to an A2 level.

The process for accessing the language courses varies depending on the region you are moving to and your current education level. This will be assessed and supported by the local "Integratie" agency.

You must apply for a Visa via the Belgian embassy through their [TLS contact website](https://visas-be.tlscontact.com/visa/gb).

As of the 1st of September 2024, everyone must apply for a Visa from the UK. The previous exemption of arriving without a Visa under "family unification under cohabitation" no longer applies. (You could previously arrive and apply for your right to reside through the city hall. This no longer appears to be an option).

#### Work Visa

For the latest information please visit the [IBZ website](https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/third-country-nationals/work).

#### Student Visa

This is usually a D Visa application. For the latest information please visit the [IBZ website](https://dofi.ibz.be/en/themes/third-country-nationals/study/initial-authorisation-stay-application-visa-d-authorisation).

> ‚úèÔ∏è TIP:  "In Autumn 2024, the EU will introduce a new digital Entry/Exit System (EES). Non-EU nationals, including UK nationals, visiting the EU will need to create a digital record when entering the EU‚Äôs Schengen Zone. This includes providing biometric data (fingerprints and facial image) at the border."

## Trans Healthcare

> **Disclaimer:** The information provided on this page is for informational purposes only and should not be considered medical advice. It is not intended to replace professional medical consultation, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare providers with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment. Do not disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you have read here.

This is a very straightforward process in Belgium. You can either add yourself to a waitlist at a hospital yourself - no need to go through a GP gatekeeping service! Or, you can go to a psychologist directly to start your gender care journey.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bad News** On 24th September 2024 we received a letter from the Leuven KU Gender Team advising that you can no longer self-refer to their Gender Team. We do not know at this point if these changes are taking place at the other Gender Teams at present. They have stated that the reason for this due to large waiting lists. Upon our last check, the waiting list is currently at a minimum of one year. You can find out more information regarding the new process and waiting times [here](https://www.upckuleuven.be/nl/raadplegingen/raadpleging-gender). *This website is in Dutch.*
> 
> The new process as defined in the letter:
> 
> 1. Renewed care offer specifically targets people with the targeted demand for a start-up of hormone therapy, with the primary goal of informing about hormonal transition and to identify the support network mapping.
> 2. To participate in the gender care program, a referral letter is required, preferably prepared by the regular sexologist or psychologist, or by the general practitioner, psychiatrist or attending physician. The gender consultation offers a template for this digital referral letter that allows you to enter the referral clearly.
> 3. Instead of long-term counseling, the gender care team now works with a series of four sessions, including one session with someone close to the patient. After these four sessions follows a possible referral to the endocrinology service for the initiation of hormone therapy. If however, it appears that there are psychological symptoms that interfere with the ability to consent to a gender-affirming treatment, a targeted referral is made for further psychotherapeutic counseling before a referral for hormone therapy can occur.
> 4. We unfortunately cannot initiate counseling, but refer to other specialised agencies:
> - if the question is of a more exploratory nature, for example in case of doubts about gender identity
> - If there is no specific request for hormone therapy
> - If the question falls within the scope of non-binarity.
> 
> Examples external bodies: convened gender centers; Transgender info point; Flemish Sexology Association. You can always re-register when the question of hormone therapy arises.

üõ£Ô∏è **Gender Care Pathway** üõ£Ô∏è

Whether you decide to use a Gender Team or organise your gender care yourself, you will roughly follow the pathway used at several hospitals. You can view this pathway [here](https://www.transgenderinfo.be/sites/default/files/2022-10/zorgpad-1.pdf). *This website is in Dutch.*

üí∞ **Costs** üí∞

Pricing is a little more complex with some hospitals being able to cover more of your costs with your health insurance than others. If you go direct to specialists outside of the gender teams you will need to ask each specialist if their work is potentially covered by health insurance. You can also contact your health insurance provider to see how much of your transition journey they cover.

‚è≤Ô∏è **Waiting Times** ‚è≤Ô∏è

The best gender team to access is the one at Gent Hospital, however they have a large waiting list. You can still put your name on a gender team's waiting list whilst you access specialists directly. This often can be a quicker way to access HRT. 


‚ù§Ô∏è **Psychological Assessment** ‚ù§Ô∏è

There is very little resistance in general from specialists and gender teams regarding your transition. The psychological assessment that everyone has to do at the start of their journey (be that a psychologist directly or one via the gender teams) is informed on LGBT+ issues and merely wants to check your family history, health history, dysphoria, gender expression, your sexuality and have some insight from friends or family. All of this gets written up into a report which then includes referrals or the first steps of recommendations for your transition. The first steps usually involve referrals to an Endocrinologist and Voice Training coaches.

üëë **Name Change and Gender Recognition** üëë

In Belgium you are usually only allowed to change your first name so we recommend changing your name via deed poll in the UK first. This way you can change your entire name, and have your passport updated before moving. When you arrive your EU ID can then be made in your new name - it is just a much more stress-free way of doing things. If you would like to learn how to change your name in the UK please visit the [Gov website](https://www.gov.uk/change-name-deed-poll).

Conversely, it is easier to have your gender recognised in Belgium once you have your ED ID card. In Belgium, you do not even have to see a Gender Team or professionals yet to change your gender on documents. You make an appointment with the City Hall with the civil registrar. 

> ‚úèÔ∏è TIP: Make sure you take the following with you to your appointment to speed things up!
> * proof of identity;
> * Signed statement (see below);
> * Extract from the criminal register, model 1 (can you request from your town or city hall).
> 
> *Example of signed statement*

>Verklaring voor de aanpassing van de registratie van het geslacht in de akten van de burgerlijke stand (artikel 135/1, ¬ß 3 oud Burgerlijk Wetboek)

> 1) Enkel van toepassing indien de aanvrager een niet-ontvoogde minderjarige is. Een aanvraag voor een niet-ontvoogde minderjarige moet door beide ouders samen worden ondertekend, zelfs indien zij gescheiden leven. Indien √©√©n of beide ouder(s) de minderjarige niet wil bijstaan kan de minderjarige aan de familierechtbank vragen om voor deze procedure bijgestaan te worden door een voogd ad hoc.


Within three days (though sometimes it can take a little longer) the civil registrar sent off to the King‚Äôs attorney for advice. The Prosecutor of the King provides advice within three months. This will be a negative opinion where the civil registrar cannot process the gender change, or no response will be received within three months, in which case the civil registrar can progress with your gender change application.

You make another appointment with the civil registrar, a minimum of three and a maximum of six months after the first appearance. If there are no contraindications, the deed to adjust the sex registration will be drawn up. Your gender will then be changed and attached to your registration number (it is similar to your national insurance number but you use it for things like your Doctor as well. This number can be found on your EU ID card).

Once your gender has been updated in Belgium, you can use this as evidence for a [Gender Recognition Certificate](https://www.gov.uk/apply-gender-recognition-certificate) in the UK so that you can update your gender on your passport as well.

As a non-legal option, you can contact the Transgender Infopunt and request a "Gender Pass". This is a card document that explains things like a deadname on official documentation, or your ID photo not quite matching up with how you present your gender now (really useful if you are not out at work but decide to by yourself at weekends!). You can apply by visiting their website [here](https://www.transgenderinfo.be/nl/expressie/genderpasje). *This website is in Dutch.*

üå± **Minors Gender Care** üå±

For under 18s, the process is slightly different. You will need to register them with a gender team or independent psychologist. They will then assist you and your child with their gender identity and transition journey. Adolescent inhibitors and HRT are currently available for minors.

## BIPOC

Like much of the UK, as well as much of Europe, Belgium is currently struggling with itself. It is a multicultural country, however, racist sentiments appear to be on the rise:

> "In the last decade, each year Belgian authorities registered between 800 and 1,400 cases of racism and xenophobia. The number of cases registered was lowest in 2013 and peaked in the most recent time period. In 2022, around 1,000 racism cases were registered. Racism accounted for roughly three-quarters of all discrimination cases in Belgium in 2022."

[Source: Racism and xenophobia cases in Belgium 2008-2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/536080/racism-and-xenophobia-cases-in-belgium/).

## Disability

Belgium offers more opportunities than the UK for disabled people to obtain work. There are projects for those of us who need more support whilst working such as those run by [MetSense](https://www.metsense.be/). Your potential employer can also access additional funds for employing staff that are disabled, which lessens some of the employment obstacles we face in the UK.

In Belgium, you are also protected from disability discrimination in areas such as education and the workplace. If you are discriminated against, there are many places you can report it such as [the UNIA](https://www.unia.be/en). 

If you use mobility aids, you are unlikely to find it easy living in Belgium. This is partly because most areas do not have things like drop curbs for wheelchairs, and shop aisles are often overcrowded. You might find things a little easier living in one of the larger cities, however, there is still a noticeable lack of accessibility. 

If you have an invisible disability such as Autism there are many charities offering advice and you will find many of them operate in English or have staff available who can speak English. 

‚úèÔ∏è TIP: Under some circumstances, you can continue claiming the Daily Living Allowance of your PIP (Personal Independence Payments) whilst living abroad. To find out more please follow the guidance on the [UK Government website](https://www.gov.uk/claim-benefits-abroad/disability-benefits).
