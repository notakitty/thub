So you are considering moving to Belgium? The great news is that Belgium is generally very LGBT+ friendly! There are plenty of rainbow meet up groups, café's and Pride events going on throughout the year.

The country is very multi-cultural as well, so you will hear a lot of different languages as you walk through the streets on you way to get a croissant from the "bakkerij" or "boulangerie". Belgium has three national languages as well just to make things more complicated 😉

The diversity of Belgium does however add a lot complexity. There are problems with some regions being far right, multiple governments, and very localised services. For such a small country it can sometimes be overwhelming! So if you don't want to deal with a lot of bureaucracy, Belgium might not be the country for you.

>"There are 5 regional governments and 1 federal government. Each federated state has its own government. As an exception, the federated states of the Flemish Community and the Flemish region have a single Flemish government. As such, there are 5 regional governments in Belgium, and 1 federal government."

Because of the complex nature of Belgium we have tried to include links to as many regional differences as possible. We always welcome contributors to add extra information, so if you would like to participate sign up to our Discord. The link can be found in the Menu.

When you arrive in Belgium there are processes for all newcomers to follow. How that looks depends on which region you move to due to the different governments.

Belgium is one of the highest taxed countries in the world. You will pay your income taxes once a year following your tax assessment so you will need to make sure you put wages aside each month in preparation to pay your tax. There is also a ground tax for your house, and various other taxes that always seem to appear from nowhere. 

✏️ TIP: A quick way to fit in with Belgian people is to complain about how much taxes you have to pay!

Housing prices vary around the country, but on average it is more expensive in the "Vlaanderen" region. For an idea of prices you can visit Statista's [Average price of a house in Belgium from 2013 to 2022](https://www.statista.com/statistics/666792/average-housing-prices-in-belgium/).

✏️ TIP: The best website to find somewhere to live is [Immoweb](https://www.immoweb.be/en). You can use it in English and it works very similarly to RightMove in the UK.

Food can be expensive in Belgium as a lot of it is imported goods. If you are on a budget, supermarkets like Aldi, Lidl or Colruyt are excellent options.

Café's always offer good quality but cheaper meals if you want to go out for a meal without spending a fortune. Just be aware that customer service is very different to in the UK and is much slower paced. Going for a meal or drinks will take you much longer than it would in the UK so be sure to factor that into your planning.

There are many takeaway options in Belgium. They have the usuals like McDonalds and Dominoes, but they also have their own chain called Quick. You can grab a kebab from a "kebap" shop but you won't find any Fish n Chip shops. Belgians go to a shop called a "frituur" in the Vlaanderen region (they also have these in the Netherlands!) which sell the worlds best chips (or frietjes/frites!) alongside lots of unique fried goods. We recommend you dip your chips in "joppie saus" or truffle mayo, then accomany it with "Bitterballen" or the "biccy burger".

📚 **Studying Here**📚
Belgium has some of the best universities in the world. International students flock to Leuven as their medical school has an excellent reputation. Cities like Leuven are very used to speaking English as a lingua franca so many shops and activites will be English speaking.

Most of the university cities have a similar situation, as well as many degrees now being taught exclusively in English. Whilst studying you can learn one of the three national languages, and they take great care of their students. 

Once you have graduated you can also stay in the country for an additional period whilst you decide to either take furthr studies or obtain work.

### Local climate

The climate is usually described as mild in Belgium. It is similar to the UK but on average has much less rainfall. You will see much more dramatic thunder and lighting storms here so look out for those! It's like watching storms in films.

### Languages

Since 1st January 2024, in order to apply for Belgian residency, you need to speak at least one of the three official languages (French, Dutch or German) to an A2 level.

The process for accessing the language courses varies depending on the region you are moving to and your current education level.
